JQuery Christmas Calendar

This Christmas Calendar is created by using JQuery. By clicking each hatch the app shows a different christmas related picture, giff or video. One can only open the hatch that is for the current or the previous day. If the calendar day is 9 or higher one can open any hatch. Once the hatch is opened ones it stays open.
